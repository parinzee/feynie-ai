# 🧠 Feynie ✨
### The open-source v-tuber student who learns when YOU teach!

Feynie turns the Feynman learning technique into an adorable, interactive coding project. Explain concepts verbally, draw on a shared whiteboard, and watch as your anime study buddy asks questions that expose your knowledge gaps!

## 🌟 What's Inside:
- Voice-powered teaching interface with React & WebRTC
- Cute v-tuber character that reacts to your explanations (Three.js)
- Interactive whiteboard for drawing concepts (Canvas API)

## 🎮 The Learning Game
Feynie gamifies the process of teaching to learn - complete with scores, teaching style analysis, and resource recommendations for any topic you're struggling to explain!

## 🤝 Perfect For:
- Web devs wanting to play with voice APIs
- ML enthusiasts looking to fine-tune educational interactions
- Open source advocates making education more accessible
- Anyone who thinks learning should involve cute anime characters asking "but why?"

## 🚀 Getting Started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parinzee/feynie-ai.git
cd feynie-ai
```

Then explain quantum physics to a waifu and become a genius. It's science!

_Because if you can't teach it to a cute AI, do you really understand it?_ 🤔
